./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0000.mp4,hey everybody this is Paul today I'm going to be showing you how to use the distance formula so the distance formula tells us the distance between two points
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0001.mp4,on an XY plane so let's say that we have two points let's say the first point is 22 and the second point is -2 -3 and we want to find the distance between these
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0002.mp4,two points so to get a visual understanding of this let's go ahead and graph these so the point 22 two is going to have an X component of Two and a y component of two so for the X component
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0003.mp4,of two we start at the origin and move over one 2 units in the X Direction and for the Y component of two we go up from the origin one two units in the y
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0004.mp4,direction and then where these little dotted lines cross right here we have the point
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0005.mp4,22 and for our second Point -2 -3 well we just go1 1 -2 in the X
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0006.mp4,Direction since -2 refers to the X component and -3 in the y direction -1
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0007.mp4,-2 -3 for our y component of -3 and where these two dotted lines cross we have the point
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0008.mp4,-2 -3 so by plugging these two points into the distance formula we're essentially
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0009.mp4,going to find the length of the line that connects the two points or the line segment that connects the two points so right now we just have some
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0010.mp4,numbers in here we don't have any X2 x1's y2s or y1s so we're simply going to label one of these points X1 y1 and the
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0011.mp4,other one X2 Y2 and it doesn't matter which you choose to be which um if you plug them into the distance formula you'll get the same answer so we're just
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0012.mp4,going to choose the first one to be X1 y1 and the second point we'll call X2
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0013.mp4,Y2 and we simply plug in these numbers where they correspond in the distance formula so the distance of this red line that I just drew is simply equal to the
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0014.mp4,square root and then we need X2 - X1 so X2 is equal to -2 it corresponds to the
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0015.mp4,left hand side of this point so -2 and we're subtracting X1 so we subtract X1 corresponds to the left hand side of this point which is a two and then
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0016.mp4,that's squared and then we add that to Y2 which is the right hand side of this point so that's a -3 and we
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0017.mp4,subract y1 and y1 corresponds to the right hand side of this point which which is a
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0018.mp4,two so the distance between those two points is simply the Square t of -2 - 2^
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0019.mp4,2 and -2 take away another 2^ 2ar is -4 2
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0020.mp4,plus -3 - 2 which is a -5^ 2ar and so now -4 2ar is the same thing as4 * -4 which is
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0021.mp4,16 and -5^ 2ar is the same thing as5 * or
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0022.mp4,25 and 16 time or 16 + 25 is 41 so the distance between the 22 and -2 -3 is
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0023.mp4,simply Square < TK of 41 so Square < TK of 41 1 is the length of this line and that is approximately
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0024.mp4,equal to 6.4 so the distance between these two points is about 6.4 if you want an exact
./clip_video/How to Find the Distance Between Two Points - How to Use the Distance Formula [0IOEPcAHgi4]/videos/clip_0025.mp4,answer then write it in this form squ < TK 41 this is the exact distance this is an approximate distance between the
