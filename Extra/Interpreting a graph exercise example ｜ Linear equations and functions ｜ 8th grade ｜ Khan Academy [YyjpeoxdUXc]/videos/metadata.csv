./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0000.mp4,The illustration below shows the graph of y as a function of x.
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0001.mp4,So that's this graph right over here.
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0002.mp4,And then they start to ask us some questions.
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0003.mp4,Complete the sentences based on the graph of the function.
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0004.mp4,"So this axis is our y-axis, the vertical axis."
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0005.mp4,Horizontal axis is x-axis.
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0006.mp4,"Initially, as x increases-- so let's think about it."
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0007.mp4,"Initially, so when we start from x equals 0 and x is increasing, what's happening to y?"
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0008.mp4,"Well, y is decreasing."
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0009.mp4,So y decreases.
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0010.mp4,"So as x increases initially, y decreases."
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0011.mp4,The slope of the graph is equal to blank for all x between x equals 0 and x equals 3.
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0012.mp4,"So x equals 0 and x equals 3, what's the slope?"
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0013.mp4,"Well, every time we move 1 in the x direction, we move down in the y direction."
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0014.mp4,We go negative 1 in the y direction.
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0015.mp4,"Move up 1 in the x direction, we go negative 1 in the y direction."
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0016.mp4,So our change in y over our change in x-- our change in y is negative 1 whenever our change in x is 1.
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0017.mp4,"So our change in y over our change in x, which is the definition of slope, is negative 1/1."
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0018.mp4,So it's negative 1.
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0019.mp4,And we see that.
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0020.mp4,"Every time x increases by 1, y decreases by 1."
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0021.mp4,"Starting at x equals 3, y blank as x increases."
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0022.mp4,"So starting at x equals 3, y increases as x increases."
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0023.mp4,"As x increases, y is increasing."
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0024.mp4,So y increases as x increases.
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0025.mp4,The slope of the graph is equal to blank for x between 3 and 5.
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0026.mp4,"So when x increases by 1, y is increasing by 3."
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0027.mp4,"So change in y is 3, change in x is 1."
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0028.mp4,"Slope is change in y over change in x, which is 3/1."
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0029.mp4,So the slope here is 3.
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0030.mp4,"Every time x increases by 1, y increases by 3."
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0031.mp4,"For x between x equals 0 and x equals 4, y-- let's see, we can pick less than or equal to, greater than or equal to, or equal."
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0032.mp4,"So for x equals 0 and x equals 4, y is less than or equal to 0."
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0033.mp4,So let's do less than or equal to 0.
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0034.mp4,"And then they say, for x between x equals 4 and x equals 8-- well, then y is greater than or equal to 0."
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0035.mp4,So let's make sure that we didn't make any careless mistakes here.
./clip_video/Interpreting a graph exercise example ｜ Linear equations and functions ｜ 8th grade ｜ Khan Academy [YyjpeoxdUXc]/videos/clip_0036.mp4,Let's check our answer.
